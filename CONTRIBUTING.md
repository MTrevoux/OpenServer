# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about  social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request. If contribution in the "git-way" with pull requests etc feel too comprehensive now, please contact one of the administators who can upload files for you, but keep in mind that learning it will make you capable of contributing to all open source projects!

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/equinor/OpenServer/issues with the 
label "bug". Please include:

* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your Python environment.

### Propose New Features

The best way to send feedback is to open an issue at https://github.com/equinor/OpenServer/issues with the label "enhancement".
If you are proposing a new feature:

* Explain in detail how it should work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

### Implement Features

Look through the Git issues for feature requests. Anything tagged with "enhancement" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Add or Improve Examples
Writing new code is not the only way to get involved and contribute. Creating examples and/or improving the existing ones is very much encouraged. Example files for python scripts should be in Jupyter Notebook format.

## Getting Started to contribute

Ready to contribute?

1. Fork the `OpenServer` repo. You can now upload files directly in your fork (drag and drop) or change some files directly and then skip points 2-5, and just do a pull request (point 6). But in many cases you want to:
2. Clone your fork locally. 
3. Create a branch for local development
4. Make your changes locally
5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub
6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Administrators of the OpenServer repo can merge pull requests.
