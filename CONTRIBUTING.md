# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about  social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request. If contribution in the "git-way" with pull requests etc feel too comprehensive now, please contact one of the administators who can upload files for you, but keep in mind that learning it will make you capable of contributing to all open source projects!

## Types of Contributions

### Add new or change existing files

Ready to contribute?

1. Fork the `OpenServer` repo. You can now upload files directly in your fork (drag and drop) or change some files directly and then skip points 2-5, and just do a pull request (point 6). But in many cases you want to:
2. Clone your fork locally. 
3. Create a branch for local development
4. Make your changes locally
5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub
6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Administrators of the OpenServer repo can merge pull requests.

Pull Request Guidelines

- All python related files should be stored under the PythonScripts directory, all excel related files under the ExcelVBA folder.
- If a script needs supporting files (e.g. a readme.md file for explaining or jupyter notebook files for examples) it should be stored in a separate directory (still under PythonScripts or ExcelVBA). The same principle applies for ExcelVBAs.
- Neither testing procedures or code reviews are enforced.

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/equinor/OpenServer/issues. Please include:

* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
* Any details about your Python environment.

### Add or Improve Examples
Writing new code is not the only way to get involved and contribute. Creating examples and/or improving the existing ones is very much encouraged. Example files for python scripts should be in Jupyter Notebook format.
